### Our Project:
Quantum computers are machines that use quantum phenomena such as superposition and entanglement to perform computation. They are believed to solve certain problems substantially faster than classical computers. Our project is an implementation of a Q-learning algorithm that uses quantum circuits to help approximate the agent's Q values. We will be comparing this implementation to its classical counterpart to see how quantum computing performs in machine learning applications.
